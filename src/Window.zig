// Static functions
/// Creates a window and its associated context.
///
/// This function creates a window and its associated OpenGL or OpenGL ES context. Most of the
/// options controlling how the window and its context should be created are specified with window
/// hints using `glfw.Window.Hints`.
///
/// Successful creation does not change which context is current. Before you can use the newly
/// created context, you need to make it current using `glfw.makeCurrentContext`. For
/// information about the `share` parameter, see context_sharing.
///
/// The created window, framebuffer and context may differ from what you requested, as not all
/// parameters and hints are hard constraints. This includes the size of the window, especially for
/// full screen windows. To query the actual attributes of the created window, framebuffer and
/// context, see glfw.Window.getAttrib, glfw.Window.getSize and glfw.window.getFramebufferSize.
///
/// To create a full screen window, you need to specify the monitor the window will cover. If no
/// monitor is specified, the window will be windowed mode. Unless you have a way for the user to
/// choose a specific monitor, it is recommended that you pick the primary monitor. For more
/// information on how to query connected monitors, see @ref monitor_monitors.
///
/// For full screen windows, the specified size becomes the resolution of the window's _desired
/// video mode_. As long as a full screen window is not iconified, the supported video mode most
/// closely matching the desired video mode is set for the specified monitor. For more information
/// about full screen windows, including the creation of so called _windowed full screen_ or
/// _borderless full screen_ windows, see window_windowed_full_screen.
///
/// Once you have created the window, you can switch it between windowed and full screen mode with
/// glfw.Window.setMonitor. This will not affect its OpenGL or OpenGL ES context.
///
/// By default, newly created windows use the placement recommended by the window system. To create
/// the window at a specific position, make it initially invisible using the `visible` window
/// hint, set its position and then show it.
///
/// As long as at least one full screen window is not iconified, the screensaver is prohibited from
/// starting.
///
/// Window systems put limits on window sizes. Very large or very small window dimensions may be
/// overridden by the window system on creation. Check the actual size after creation.
///
/// The swap interval is not set during window creation and the initial value may vary depending on
/// driver settings and defaults.
///
/// Possible errors include glfw.ErrorCode.InvalidEnum, glfw.ErrorCode.InvalidValue,
/// glfw.ErrorCode.APIUnavailable, glfw.ErrorCode.VersionUnavailable, glfw.ErrorCode.FormatUnavailable and
/// glfw.ErrorCode.PlatformError.
/// Returns null in the event of an error.
///
/// Parameters are as follows:
///
/// * `width` The desired width, in screen coordinates, of the window.
/// * `height` The desired height, in screen coordinates, of the window.
/// * `title` The initial, UTF-8 encoded window title.
/// * `monitor` The monitor to use for full screen mode, or `null` for windowed mode.
/// * `share` The window whose context to share resources with, or `null` to not share resources.
///
/// win32: Window creation will fail if the Microsoft GDI software OpenGL implementation is the
